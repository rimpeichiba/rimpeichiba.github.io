							<b>Galactic echoes</b></a><br><br>
							We considered the possibility that the vertical phase-space spirals discovered by Gaia contain manifestations of 'phase-space echoes'. First established in plasma physics in the 1960s, echoes arise when a collisionless system is perturbed twice: the macroscopic responses to both perturbations mix to small scales in phase space, whereupon they couple non-linearly, producing a third macroscopic 'echo' response without the need for a third perturbation. We derive the galactic analogue of the plasma echo theory using angle-action variables and apply it to a one-dimensional model of vertical motion in the Galactic stellar disk. We verify the predicted echo behaviour using particle simulations, both with and without the inclusion of diffusion through orbital scattering off molecular clouds. We find that echoes are common and can survive longer than the original response at late times, since the latter are more tightly wound and hence more vulnerable to destruction by diffusion. This implies that the degree of winding of the observed phase spirals may not always indicate the time elapsed since the perturbation.

							<b>Galaxy Zoo CEERS: Bar Fractions Up to z ~ 4.0</b></a><br><br>
							We study the evolution of the bar fraction in disk galaxies between 0.5 < z < 4.0 using multiband colored images from JWST Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS). We find that the fraction of weak bars decreases with increasing redshift, whereas the fraction of strong bars remains constant between 0.5 < z < 2.5. This implies that disk instabilities, in which bars grow secularly, are the dominant mode of bar formation at lower redshifts, while bar formation through interactions and mergers, in which large strong bars form rapidly, is more common at higher redshifts.

							The most metal-poor tail of the Milky Way contains a population of stars with very prograde planar orbits, which is puzzling in both their origin and evolution. We investigated the possibility that the metal poor stars were resonantly dragged by the bar from the inner Galaxy, where many of the old and low-metallicity stars in the Galaxy are located.

							<b>Origin of reduced dynamical friction by dark matter haloes with net prograde rotation</b></a><br><br>
							Dynamical friction has long been known to be suppressed when dark haloes are rotating in the same sense as the disk. We provided a theoretical explanation to this using both linear and nonlinear theory. The key role is played by the direct-radial resonances, which are strongest when orbits are perpendicular to the galactic plane \((L_z = 0)\). Since rotating the halo forward typically generates a positive gradient in the distribution function near \(L_{z} = 0\), these resonances exert a strong positive torque on the bar, weakening the overall dynamical friction.

							<b>Dynamical friction and feedback on galactic bars in the general fast-slow regime</b></a><br><br>
							We provided a general theory of dynamical friction on galactic bars in the nonlinear (non-perturbative) regime. Our theory seamlessly connects past theories based on the linear approximation, which is only valid in the fast limit, and the extreme adiabatic approximation, which is only valid in the slow limit (i.e. constant pattern speed). In particular, we derived the complete analytical formula for <i>dynamical feedback</i>, a nonlinear process that transfers energy between waves and particles due to the shift in resonances.
							<!--
							When a perturber (e.g. bar, satellite galaxy) changes its frequency in response to dynamical friction,
							the resonances shift, resulting in an additional transfer of angular momentum:
							trapped particles dragged by the resonance typically gain angular momentum,
							while untrapped particles skirting around the trapped phase-space lose angular momentum.
							This torque, referred to as <i>dynamical feedback</i>, directly depends on the rate of change in pattern speed
							and therefore modifies the moment of inertia of the perturber.
							We derived an analytical expression for dynamical feedback and applied the formula to the Galactic bar.

							<b>Oscillating dynamical friction on galactic bars by trapped dark matter</b></a><br><br>
							We described the mechanism of dynamical friction in the presence of nonlinear resonant trapping. We showed that, due to the initial gradient in the dark halo's distribution function, net angular momentum is transferred to the halo as trapped particles librate and phase mix. Conventional linear perturbation theory fails to capture this nonlinear behaviour (top). We successfully modeled this process using the resonant angle-action coordinates (bottom) and predicted that dynamical friction on galactic bars may undergo damped oscillation.

							<b>Tree-ring structure of Galactic bar resonance</b></a><br><br>
							We identified a "tree-ring structure" in the phase space of the bar's resonance: the resonance grows inside-out with stars captured earlier occupying the core of the resonance. We showed that the local stellar metallicity increases monotonically towards the core of the bar's corotation resonance, indicating that the resonance has migrated from the inner galaxy where the metallicity is higher. This observation corroborates the bar's spin-down and hence dynamical friction by dark matter.
